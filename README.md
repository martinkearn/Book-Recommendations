A# Recommendations Sample
This is a simple sample of how to call the [Microsoft Cognitive Recommendations API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/recommendations/) in ASP.Net Core 1.1.

The sample is a simple web application which presents a very basic e-commerce store experience using a Microsoft store sample dataset which has already been configured with recommendation Item-to-item and FBT builds. This application is dpeloyed at http://recommendationsapi.azurewebsites.net/

The sample data has been taken from http://aka.ms/RecoSampleData.

The application is designed so that the catalog data is interchangable.
