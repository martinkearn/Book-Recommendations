# Recommendations Sample
This is a simple application showing how to call the [Microsoft Cognitive Recommendations API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/recommendations/) in ASP.Net Core 1.1.

This is a simple web application which presents a very basic e-commerce store experience using a sample dataset which has already been configured with recommendation api. 

The web application uses the exact same data file as the 'catalog' file for the recommendations API and so is easily interchangable for different catalogs. You can get sample data based around a collection of books or the Microsoft store from http://aka.ms/RecoSampleData

The application is deployed at http://recommendationsapi.azurewebsites.net/
